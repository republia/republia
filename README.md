# Republia
Republia Blockchain and Smart-Contracts open source code. 

# About Republia 
Republia is a decentralized ecosystem, that within one project combines all operating mechanisms of blockchain technology, that are in demand in the industry. The ecosystem is based on an innovative technology, which, in turn, buttressed by a proprietary blockchain, implemented using the functional programming language - OCaml, because it minimizes hacking the code of smart contracts, maintaining formal code verification.

# Consensus Republia 
Consensus Republia operates on an improved algorithm Republia-Delegated-Proof-of-Authority (RDPoA) + BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance). Algorithm RPoA operates on the basis of RepubliaID verification and helps to avoid attacks, because users own unique RepubliaID, which ensures the reliability of each ecosystem participant and the confidence that one participant within the framework of voting for modernization of both technological and ideological decisions will be able to vote only once.

# Republia Smart Contract Platform 
Is Turing complete platform, where each smart contract operates accurately, taking into account embedded algorithm. Turing completeness excludes fraud, delays or malfunctions.The entire system operates autonomously. Due to this technology, in Republia Smart Contract Platform thouthands of digital contracts can operate simultaneously.

# Smart contracts 
In Republia Smart Contract Platform operate on the principle of timestamp, without using GAS, which guarantees exact execution of the transaction and avoidance of situation when smart contract goes to an endless cycle.
The timestamp was chosen for the convenience of using and binding the smart contract cycles to the time.

We are looking forward to collaborating with developers and waiting for enthusiastic people who are ready to join our team for future development and improvement of Republia technology.
